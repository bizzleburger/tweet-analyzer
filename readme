This program should probably be run in an IDE like Eclipse, it is not meant to be a stand alone
application. All output prints to the console, and can be copied to a flat text file for analysis
in a separate application, such as Excel. Import into Ecplise, and run as the TweetAnalyzer App.
Press Terminate to stop streaming, as it won't stop until you kill the app.

Also included in the zip file is a class diagram.
